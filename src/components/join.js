            01. Do I need to be interested in both tech &amp; design to join?
          </p>
          <p className="faq-answer">
            Nope! As long as you're curious about one of the fields, we welcome
            you to apply. We don't expect developers to design or desginers to
            develop, although the option is open if you're interested in both!
