      Each semester, our members come together to work on a variety of
      engineering and/or design projects. In the past, projects have ranged
      from redesigning a startupâ€™s pilot program helping students
      with ADHD to developing a machine learning model that identifies
      pictures as emojis. We work on both client and passion projects!
