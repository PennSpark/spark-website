      <h2 className="stroke">WHY JOIN?</h2>
      <WhyContainer>
        <Why>
          <h3>Gain Experience</h3>
          <p>Members gain a range of technical and interpersonal experience through project development
            on teams. Blue members learn and apply our tech stack of Figma (for designers) or HTML/CSS,
            React.js, and Django (for developers), while Red members deepen their current skillset through
            building more technically rigorous projects.</p>
          <p>We accept students from all majors and experience levels, and highly encourage anyone with
            a curiosity for tech and/or design to apply!</p>
        </Why>
        <Why>
          <h3>Join Our Community</h3>
          <p>Outside of work, our organization has a strong emphasis on community. This upcoming semester, weâ€™re planning on doing our first overnight club-wide retreat ðŸ‘€, intra-club mixers, food runs, study sessions, BYO/karaoke, and general member hangouts.</p>
          <p>For more information, check out our community page!</p>
        </Why>
        <Why>
          <h3>Gain Experience</h3>
          <p>Spark fully encourages the professional growth of our members. Our Red members have the
            opportunity to gain industry experience by working closely with our clients, and some of our
            members even go on to pursue paid full-time internships with our client companies.</p>
          <p>Additionally, Spark hosts a mentorship program between upperclassmen and underclassmen,
            workshops on resume writing and recruiting, and an internal referral network.</p>

      <h2 className="stroke">FAQ</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Do I need to be interested in both tech & design to join?</strong></p>
          <p>Nope! As long as you're curious about one of the fields, we welcome you to apply.
            We don't expect developers to design or designers to develop, although the option is
            open if you're interested in both!</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Which track should I apply for: Blue or Red?</strong></p>
          <p><strong>For Developers: </strong>
            If you have CIS120/equivalent experience, familiarity with web development
            frameworks (or can pick up new frameworks fairly easily), and/or previous software engineering
            internship experience, we recommend applying for Red. If you're new to coding or web development
            in general, we recommend applying for Blue. Feel free to apply for both if you're unsure which
            one suits you better!</p>
          <p><strong>For Designers: </strong>
            If you have experience with Figma/Adobe Suite, a design portfolio, and/or
            previous design internship experience, we recommend applying for Red. If you're new to design
            or looking to build up your fundamentals, we recommend applying for Blue. Feel free to apply for
            both if you're unsure which one suits you better!</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>What makes a strong applicant?</strong></p>
          <p>While there's no cookie-cutter answer, we generally look for curiosity in tech and/or
            design, community-fit, and demonstrated interest in our org.</p>
