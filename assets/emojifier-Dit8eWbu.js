Working with Flask for the first time was a challenge for us as we tried to figure out Flask-specific details to file structures such as where to place all our static files. Getting used to Git, integrating the web application with the machine learning portion, and working with OpenCV for the first time also posed a challenge for us. While trying to integrate the webcam OpenCV,  we ran into the problem of circular dependency between our files that we couldn’t quite wrap our head around.
