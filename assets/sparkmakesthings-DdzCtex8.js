Our project members were given the freedom of tackling different problems in life and reimagining how these products could be produced. All of these projects were possible by exploring skillsets outside of programming and web development. These ranges from CAD, laser cutting, building circuits, and casting! From small home decors to electric-circuit cars, let’s hear about the design processes from each project team and feel free to come check out the products after the presentation!
