When I was younger I always used to talk to my stuffed animals thinking they also had feelings and thoughts. What if you could take pictures of a stuffed animal, upload them digitally, and interact with them in digital form in an app? The project's applications are for memory preservation and virtual play. What better way to preserve your stuffed animal than scanning it into a 3D digital animal you can play games with? This started as a cute concept that fits Spark’s values and blossomed into an opportunity for technical rigor and design/creative outlets."]},{title:"Timeline",content:[e.jsxs("ul",{children:[e.jsx("li",{children:"Week 0: Feb 12 - Feb 18 (Pre-Onboarding): Initial Expectations"}),e.jsx("li",{children:"Week 1: Feb 18 - Feb 24: Designers: Create a joint document (link in masters google slides).

Decide on 3D Digitization Tech (MeshRoom, other options), Go through the Meshroom Flow using example images. Decide Backend framework (Flask/Django).

We had to shift gears to a new photogrammetry architecture called Apple Object Capture. This new architecture was free to use, but it needed to be ran on a Mac computer. We had to switch to hosting our photogrammetry process on a Macbook, and making API calls to and from the Macbook which interacted with the API, database, and frontend."}),e.jsx("li",{children:"File Handling (images and .obj model files): We dealt with difficult files such as 50+ image files and 3D model .obj files.

We also worked with a lot of parallelism in the various calls of the photogrammetry process."}),e.jsx("li",{children:"Network Architecture and Deployment: Because of our architecture shift, we faced challenges deploying the application to multiple users.
