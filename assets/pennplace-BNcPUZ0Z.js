However, we wanted to take the project a step further by asking the question: 'what if we extended it to 3D?' This one question inspired us to redefine the way users could collaboratively create art on the browser. As we took on the challenge of building this project, we were uncertain whether our vision for the 3D canvas would pan out. But this uncertainly made launching Penn Place even more exciting and left us curious about what people would build.
