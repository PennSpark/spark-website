Or, have you ever wanted to see all the subletting options in a single place rather than in a GroupMe? If so, then Penn Market is for you!
Penn Market is a place for Penn students to buy and sell almost anything students here need, from educational materials to housing and other lifestyle items. We found that finding these things on resources like Facebook Marketplace is daunting and too generic – thus, we sought to develop a more personalized platform for Penn students, in which, as a student, you can search up products, buy/sell, and compile what you have purchased or put up for sale.`]},{title:"Timeline",content:[e.jsxs("ul",{children:[e.jsx("li",{children:"Week 1 (1/22-1/28): Set up Github repo and Figma, grant access to Blue VP and mentors, set up group timeline, review resources for mentors and other helpful people"}),e.jsx("li",{children:"Week 2 (1/29-2/4): Developers: link frontend/backend, Designers: finalize features + redesigning logo"}),e.jsx("li",{children:"Week 3 (2/5 - 2/11) : Developers: setup product database & user information database, Designers: first draft hi-fi mockup for all pages"}),e.jsx("li",{children:"Week 4 (2/12 - 2/18): Developers: implement product posting function, Designers: second draft hi-fi mockup for all pages"}),e.jsx("li",{children:"Weeks 5 & 6 (2/26 - 3/3): Devs/Designers: Work on deliverables for Week 7 & 8"}),e.jsxs("li",{children:["Week 7 (3/4 - 3/10): Developers: implement category search with product tags & flush out product posting functionality can search based on tags and name, Designers: final hi-fi draft / modifications"," "]}),e.jsx("li",{children:"Week 9 (3/18 - 3/24): Developers: frontend home page & instruction page, implement user authentication (including required penn email), Designers: hi-fi updates based on midpoint feedback"}),e.jsxs("li",{children:["Week 10 (3/25 - 3/31): Developers: frontend user pages, implement personalized sessions, Designers: hi-fi updates based on midpoint feedback"," "]}),e.jsxs("li",{children:["Week 11 (4/1 - 4/7): Developers: frontend product pages, continue implementing personalized sessions, Designers: hi-fi updates based on midpoint feedback"," "]}),e.jsx("li",{children:"Week 12 (4/8 - 4/14): Developers: frontend search pages, integration with backend features, Designers: final updates based with current implementation"}),e.jsxs("li",{children:["Week 13 (4/15 - 4/21): Developers: implementation of final design tweaks, Designers: final updates based with current implementation"," "]}),e.jsx("li",{children:"Week 14 (4/22 - 4/29): SHOWCASE!

In terms of design, the main challenge was applying the tools we learnt from the bootcamp to a real-life design problem.
