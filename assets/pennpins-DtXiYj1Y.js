Penn SPARK is pie-ing its two directors for charity next to the Quad!' Since you’re Nick and Andre’s friend, you really want to shove some cranberry pie in their nostrils. Seeing that the quad is only 2 minutes away from your current location, you find it convenient to walk to the quad for a quick detour. 'Penn Pins' is a social exploration app designed to help students discover campus and connect with each other in real life. As students walk around, they receive notifications for location-based “pins” dropped by other students and campus organizations—each with recommendations, events, and hidden gems nearby. With only one pin per day, users make each pin meaningful and personalized. Verified organizations can post event pins, turning the campus into a live feed of activities and spontaneous opportunities. Penn Pins is your guide to new spots, events, and connections, all within a short walk."]},{title:"Timeline",content:[e.jsxs("div",{children:[e.jsx("p",{children:"Week 1"}),e.jsx("ul",{children:e.jsx("li",{children:"Brainstorm features, finalize project requirements"})}),e.jsx("p",{children:"Week 2"}),e.jsxs("ul",{children:[e.jsx("li",{children:"Developers: Learn React Native and NodeJS, discuss database"}),e.jsx("li",{children:"Designers: Ideation for overall vibe and user experience, search for references"}),e.jsx("li",{children:"Goal: Finalize theme, features, user flow, etc."})]}),e.jsx("p",{children:"Week 3"}),e.jsxs("ul",{children:[e.jsx("li",{children:"Developers: Database models for locations and users, landing page with map"}),e.jsx("li",{children:"Designers: Solidify UI with features and information architecture"})]}),e.jsx("p",{children:"Week 4"}),e.jsxs("ul",{children:[e.jsx("li",{children:"Developers: User authentication, landmark pages (organize info + social feature)"}),e.jsx("li",{children:"Designers: Lo-fi mockup"})]}),e.jsx("p",{children:"Week 5"}),e.jsxs("ul",{children:[e.jsx("li",{children:"Developers: Interface for viewing single landmark, backend functionality"}),e.jsx("li",{children:"Designers: Style guide and design system"})]}),e.jsx("p",{children:"Week 6"}),e.jsxs("ul",{children:[e.jsx("li",{children:"Developers: Re-do database, connect map with backend, build screens"}),e.jsx("li",{children:"Designers: Work on hi-fi"})]}),e.jsx("p",{children:"Week 7"}),e.jsxs("ul",{children:[e.jsx("li",{children:"Developers: Finish screens, drag-drop bulletin board with backend integration"}),e.jsx("li",{children:"Designers: Complete high-fidelity prototype"})]}),e.jsx("p",{children:"Week 8 (Thanksgiving Break)"}),e.jsx("ul",{children:e.jsx("li",{children:"Debug and work on stretch features"})}),e.jsx("p",{children:"Week 9"}),e.jsx("ul",{children:e.jsx("li",{children:"Final checks, prepare showcase materials"})})]},"t1")]},{title:"Challenges",content:[e.jsxs("ul",{children:[e.jsx("li",{children:"Design challenge: Product pivot: This project began as a social app where users could post pictures and comments only visible at specific locations on campus.
